Implementation Details
Make it themable.
Use SASS for the styling. 
Via a config file on your SASS code define a set of 4 (or more) colours and reuse them among the full extend of your app.


Use state management
Use observables & Angular services / optionally you can play with ngrx instead of services


Make it modular.
The questionnaire should be exported as a reusable module (even via npm as a second step) which should be reusable / embeddable to any Angular application. Ask but make it happen


Make it object oriented.
Use factory pattern to create your questionnaire components (create one component per question type).


Make it extendable.
Make sure your questionnaire module can be extended by adding new question types.


Remember your users.
Use localstorage to remember user’s answers and provide a “start again” button to the users that have already finished the questionnaire.
